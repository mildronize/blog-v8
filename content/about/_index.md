# Get to know me

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Thada, a **software engineer and DevSecOps enthusiast** with a knack for solving complex challenges and building secure, scalable infrastructures. Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working on everything from automating workflows with Terraform and GitHub Actions to mentoring teams and fostering a collaborative DevOps culture. My focus has always been on crafting solutions that are not just functional but also efficient and reliable.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve worn multiple hatsâ€”from leading DevOps teams to teaching university courses in web development, mobile apps, and game programming. These experiences have shaped my passion for both technical innovation and knowledge sharing. Whether itâ€™s designing a modular framework, bringing legacy systems into the modern CI/CD pipeline, or ensuring SOC2 compliance, I thrive on blending technical depth with a strategic approach.

When Iâ€™m not immersed in the tech world, you might find me contributing to the community through talks or workshops, or simply exploring creative outlets like photography. My journey is a mix of curiosity, learning, and building meaningful projects that make a difference.

Curious to know more about my professional adventures and achievements? Head over to my [resume page](/resume) to dive deeper into my story. Itâ€™s a great way to see how my experiences align with your interests or projects!
